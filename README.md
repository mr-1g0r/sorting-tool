# Stage 3/6: Sorting it out

## Description
This project is called Sorting Tool, but, so far, you still havenâ€™t really sorted the elements of the user input. Let's add a number-sorting mechanism to the program and provide an appropriate command-line argument to use this function.

The new optional -sortIntegers argument indicates that the input numbers should be sorted.

## Objectives
Update the parsing of command-line arguments to support the number sorting option.

If the -sortIntegers argument is provided, ignore the other arguments and output two lines: the first containing the total number of numbers in the input, and the second containing all of the input numbers in ascending order.

If the -sortIntegers argument is not provided, the behavior of the program should be the same as in the previous stage.

## Example
### Run configuration example:

`java SortingTool -sortIntegers`

### Run example

The greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.
```
> 1 -2   33 4
> 42
> 1                 1
Total numbers: 7.
Sorted data: -2 1 1 1 4 33 42
```
